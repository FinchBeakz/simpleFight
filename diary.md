testing github... yay!
So this will be a (mostly unedited) diary about me learning to code.
Have fun reading it, i guess.. ;)
Uploaded first 2 Game Versions. My first big goal is to code a text based role playing game in which one can explore dungeons, fight monsters, gain experience for the character(s) and find loot to equip.
One "Dungeon run" would be automatic with an event log at the end to see what happened to your adventurers. To be successfull you would have to set up your actions in advance and tell your adventurers what to do at each room of the dungeon. If you strategy fails, you have to tune it to better fit what happens in the dungeon.
Right now i chose Python, because i had a Textbook lying around.
Something resembling kind of a roadmap:
1. Implement more and more complex game mechanics
2. Implement a gui, but keep it text based
3. Take the thing online.. maybe.. very late goal though
One last comment about the nature of my project: it is definitely inspired by a game called "World of Dungeons" (http://world-of-dungeons.de/), a german textbased roleplaying game. It seemed like a manageable blueprint for a project for me to keep me engaged learning how to code.
Also: totaly possible, that this whole thing ends nowhere and i ghost this project like so many others. But i donÂ´t hope so.
